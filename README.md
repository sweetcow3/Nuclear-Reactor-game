For a more in-depth explaination, you can find it here: https://wiki.industrial-craft.net/index.php?title=Old_Reactor_Mechanics_and_Components .

An old mod called IndustrailCraft 2 for a popular video game called Minecraft had a minigame associated with it to design nuclear reactors.
You want them to be as efficient with the resources as possible while being as fast as possible and as safe as possible (assuming no breaks).

I am making this bot to both determine the safety and output of specific designs and also determine the best designs of every category.
